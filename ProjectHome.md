This is a cross-platform framework for building virtual cameras.  Virtual cameras offer the same interface as regular cameras to client applications (such as Skype), but provide user-generated or user-modified imagery rather than imagery directly from a camera. While ucanvcam comes with a set of special effects, the main intent is to make building virtual cameras easier for people without OS-specific knowledge, so they can focus purely on image processing.
